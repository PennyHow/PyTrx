# Image sets for PyTrx examples
This folder contains the camera environment data needed to run the examples provided with PyTrx. The camera numbers and references correspond with those given in the PyTrx methods paper:

<b>How et al. (In Review) PyTrx: A Python toolbox for deriving velocities, surface areas and line measurements from oblique imagery in glacial environments. *Geoscientific Instrumentation, Methods and Data Systems Discussion*</b>

The example image sets distributed with PyTrx were collected as part of <a href="https://www.researchinsvalbard.no/project/7037">CRIOS</a> (Calving Rates and Impact On Sea level), and are used here with permission.

<h3>Kronebreen camera 1 image set (KR1_2014_subset)</h3>
Images collected from time-lapse camera site 1 at Kronebreen. This specific sequence consists of four images, collected every two hours between 5th July 16:00-22:00. This image set is used for deriving areas of meltwater plume extents (driver_manualarea.py).

<h3>Kronebreen camera 2 image set (KR2_2014_subset)</h3>
Images collected from time-lapse camera site 2 at Kronebreen. This specific sequence consists of six images, roughly collected on a daily basis (subject to conditions) between 8th-15th May. This image set is used for deriving glacier surface velocities (driver_velocity.py).

<h3>Kronebreen camera 3 image set (KR3_2014_subset)</h3>
Images collected from time-lapse camera site 3 at Kronebreen. This specific sequence consists of four images, roughly collected on a daily basis (subject to conditions) between 25th-28th June. This image set is used for deriving areas of supraglacial lakes (driver_autoarea.py).

<h3>Tunabreen image set (TU1_2015_subset)</h3><br>
Images collected from time-lapse camera site 1 at Tunabreen. This specific sequence consists of four images, roughly collected on a daily basis (subject to conditions) between 19th-23rd August. This image set is used for deriving georectified point locations of calving events (driver_ptsgeorectify.py) and sequential terminus profiles (driver_manualline.py).
