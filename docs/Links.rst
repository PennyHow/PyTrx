The DEM of the Kongsfjorden area provided as an example dataset for PyTrx originates from the freely available DEM dataset provided by the Norwegian Polar Institute, data product 'S0 Terrengmodell - Delmodell_5m_2009_13822_33 (GeoTIFF)'. This data is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license:

The two DEMs distributed with PyTrx for the Kongsfjorden region are *KR_demsmooth.tif* and *KR_demzero.tif*, which have been modified and manipulated from the original NPI data. In both cases, the scene has been clipped to the area of interest, downgraded to 20 metre resolution, and smoothed using a linear interpolation method. The latter of these DEMs has been manipulated in order to better represent the terminus position of Kronebreen in 2014 (the time at which the images were taken) and project meltwater plumes to a flat, homogeneous surface at sea level.

The DEM of the Tempelfjorden area provided as an example dataset for PyTrx originates from ArcticDEM, Scene ID: WV01_20130714_1020010 (July 14, 2013). There is no license for the ArcticDEM data and it can be used and distributed freely. The DEM was created from DigitalGlobe, Inc., imagery and funded under National Science Foundation awards 1043681, 1559691, and 1542736. 

The DEM distributed with PyTrx of the Tempelfjorden region is called *TU_demzero.tif*, which has been modified and manipulated from the original ArcticDEM data. The scene has been clipped to the area of interest, downgraded to 20 metre resolution, and all low-lying elevations (< 150 m) have been transformed to 0 m a.s.l. in order to project point locations and line profiles to a flat, homogeneous surface at sea level.

The example image sets and UAV-derived DEM from Qasigiannguit glacier are used courtesy of `Asiaq Greenland Survey <https://www.asiaq-greenlandsurvey.gl/frontpage/>`_ as part of Messerli et al. (In Review), through GlacioBasis Nuuk under the `GEM (Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring) programme <https://g-e-m.dk/>`_. The DEM file provided as *QAS_drone_dem.tif* was acquired from UAV surveying in September 2020 and downgraded to 20 metre resolution.

This work would not have been possible without the CRIOS (Calving Rates and Impact on Sea Level) project, who own the example image sets distributed with PyTrx.

Parts of the georectification functions in the PyTrx toolbox were inspired and translated from `ImGRAFT <http://imgraft.glaciology.net/>`_, a photogrammetry toolbox for Matlab (`Messerli and Grinsted, 2015 <https://www.geosci-instrum-method-data-syst.net/4/23/2015/gi-4-23-2015.html>`_). Where possible, ImGRAFT has been credited for in the corresponding PyTrx scripts (primarily some passages in the CamEnv.py script) and cited in relevant PyTrx publications.
