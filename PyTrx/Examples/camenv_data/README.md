# Camera Environment data for PyTrx examples
This folder contains the camera environment data needed to run the examples provided with PyTrx. <br>

<hr>

<h3>Camera calibration files (calib)</h3>
Text and image files for determining information about the camera matrix and lens parameters, which are needed to correct images for distortion. The text files contain the camera matrix and lens distortion parameters already calculated - four separate calibrations were performed for first of the Kronebreen cameras (KR1), and one was calculated for the Tunabreen camera (TU1). Where defined (in the camera environment text file), PyTrx will take an average of multiple calibration files. Calibration images from the second and third Kronebreen cameras (KR2 and KR3) are provided in the two folders of images, which are used to calculate the camera matrix and lens distortion parameters within PyTrx and its calibration capabilities. This can either be defined in the camera environment text file, or performed in situ (see one of the extended example scripts for an example).

<hr>

<h3>Camera Environment text files (camenv)</h3>
Text files for defining data (camera location and pose) and mapping the relevant data paths (GCPs DEM, reference image, calibration file), which are needed to construct the camera environment. 

<hr>

<h3>Digital elevation models (dem)</h3>
DEMs for defining the camera environment and performing georectification. More details about these DEMs are provided below, as previously outlined in the previous PyTrx README files. <br>

<b>*1. Kongsfjorden DEMs*</b><br>
The DEM of the Kongsfjorden area provided as an example dataset for PyTrx originates from the freely available DEM dataset provided by the <a href="https://geodata.npolar.no/">Norwegian Polar Institute</a>, data product 'S0 Terrengmodell - Delmodell_5m_2009_13822_33 (GeoTIFF)'. This data is licensed under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license</a>:<br>

The two DEMs distributed with PyTrx for the Kongsfjorden region are 'KR_demsmooth.tif' and 'KR_demzero.tif', which have been modified and manipulated from the original NPI data. In both cases, the scene has been clipped to the area of interest, downgraded to 20 metre resolution, and smoothed using a linear interpolation method. The latter of these DEMs has been manipulated in order to better represent the terminus position of Kronebreen in 2014 (the time at which the images were taken) and project meltwater plumes to a flat, homogeneous surface at sea level. <br>

<b>*2. Tempelfjorden DEM*</b><br>
The DEM of the Tempelfjorden area provided as an example dataset for PyTrx originates from <a href="https://www.pgc.umn.edu/data/arcticdem/">ArcticDEM</a>, Scene ID: WV01_20130714_1020010 (July 14, 2013). <a href="https://www.pgc.umn.edu/guides/arcticdem/additional-information/">There is no license for the ArcticDEM data and it can be used and distributed freely</a>. The DEM was created from DigitalGlobe, Inc., imagery and funded under National Science Foundation awards 1043681, 1559691, and 1542736. <br>

The DEM distributed with PyTrx of the Tempelfjorden region is called 'TU_demzero.tif', which has been modified and manipulated from the original ArcticDEM data. The scene has been clipped to the area of interest, downgraded to 20 metre resolution, and all low-lying elevations (< 150 m) have been transformed to 0 m a.s.l. in order to project point locations and line profiles to a flat, homogeneous surface at sea level. 

<hr>

<h3>Ground control points (gcps)</h3>
Text files containing the coordinates for the ground control points, corresponding to image positions and real-world coordinates. The text files are  specifically formatted as follows: X, Y, Z (real-world coordinates), X, Y (pixel coordinates).

<hr>

<h3>Image registration masks (invmasks)</h3>
The boolean image masks that are needed for tracking static features and performing image registration. <br>

<hr>

<h3>Feature-tracking masks (masks)</h3>
The boolean image masks for masking areas of interest, used subsequently for either tracking moving features and performing feature-tracking (e.g. glacier surface velocities), or for detecting areal features (e.g. supraglacial lakes).

<hr>

<h3>Reference Images (refimages)</h3>
The reference images from which the image-based GCPs are derived. <br>
