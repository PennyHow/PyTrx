# Image sets for PyTrx examples
This folder contains the camera environment data needed to run the examples provided with PyTrx. The camera numbers and references correspond with those given in the PyTrx methods paper:

<h3>How et al. (2020) PyTrx: a Python-based monoscopic terrestrial photogrammetry toolset for glaciology. <i>Frontiers in Earth Science</i> 8:21, <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2020.00021">doi:10.3389/feart.2020.00021</a></h3>

The example image sets distributed with PyTrx were collected as part of <a href="https://www.researchinsvalbard.no/project/7037">CRIOS</a> (Calving Rates and Impact On Sea level), and are used here with permission.

<h3>Kronebreen camera 1 image set (KR1_2014_subset)</h3>
Images collected from time-lapse camera site 1 at Kronebreen. This specific sequence consists of four images, collected every two hours between 5th July 16:00-22:00. This image set is used for deriving areas of meltwater plume extents (driver_manualarea.py).

<h3>Kronebreen camera 2 image set (KR2_2014_subset)</h3>
Images collected from time-lapse camera site 2 at Kronebreen. This specific sequence consists of six images, roughly collected on a daily basis (subject to conditions) between 8th-15th May. This image set is used for deriving glacier surface velocities (driver_velocity.py and driver_velocity_extended.py).

<h3>Kronebreen camera 3 image set (KR3_2014_subset)</h3>
Images collected from time-lapse camera site 3 at Kronebreen. This specific sequence consists of four images, roughly collected on a daily basis (subject to conditions) between 25th-28th June. This image set is used for deriving areas of supraglacial lakes (driver_autoarea.py and driver_autoarea_extended.py).

<h3>Tunabreen image set (TU1_2015_subset)</h3>

Images collected from time-lapse camera site 1 at Tunabreen. This specific sequence consists of four images, roughly collected on a daily basis (subject to conditions) between 19th-23rd August. This image set is used for deriving georectified point locations of calving events (driver_ptsgeorectify.py) and sequential terminus profiles (driver_manualline.py and driver_manualline_extended.py).
